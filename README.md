    <b>Business Problem:</b> 🎯 Netflix wants to gain a deeper understanding of subscriber preferences and content performance across its vast library of shows and movies. With over 82,000 records spanning multiple genres, countries, and years, manually analyzing this data is nearly impossible. Without proper insights, it becomes challenging to make data-driven decisions for content strategy, marketing, and viewer engagement. Netflix needs a robust, scalable method to extract meaningful patterns that highlight popular genres, trending releases, and regional preferences.

  <p>
    <b>Solution Approach:</b> 🛠️ I will leverage SQL to process and analyze the large dataset efficiently, enabling the extraction of key metrics such as average viewer ratings, genre distribution, release trends, and country-wise popularity. Once the data is prepared, I will use Tableau to create interactive dashboards and visualizations that allow Netflix stakeholders to explore the insights dynamically. This approach ensures that trends and patterns are easily understandable, actionable, and can directly inform Netflix’s content acquisition, recommendation systems, and marketing strategies.
