    <b>Business Problem:</b> üéØ Netflix wants to gain a deeper understanding of subscriber preferences and content performance across its vast library of shows and movies. With over 82,000 records spanning multiple genres, countries, and years, manually analyzing this data is nearly impossible. Without proper insights, it becomes challenging to make data-driven decisions for content strategy, marketing, and viewer engagement. Netflix needs a robust, scalable method to extract meaningful patterns that highlight popular genres, trending releases, and regional preferences.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Solution Approach:</b> üõ†Ô∏è I will leverage SQL to process and analyze the large dataset efficiently, enabling the extraction of key metrics such as average viewer ratings, genre distribution, release trends, and country-wise popularity. Once the data is prepared, I will use Tableau to create interactive dashboards and visualizations that allow Netflix stakeholders to explore the insights dynamically. This approach ensures that trends and patterns are easily understandable, actionable, and can directly inform Netflix‚Äôs content acquisition, recommendation systems, and marketing strategies.

<p>The IMDb score serves as a trusted benchmark for gauging the popularity, impact, and overall quality of movies and shows. The top 10 titles in this analysis reflect content that resonated strongly with audiences ‚Äî receiving widespread praise for storytelling, performances, and production value. These high-performing titles represent the kind of content that keeps viewers engaged and enhances Netflix‚Äôs reputation for premium entertainment. Conversely, the bottom 10 titles reveal the less successful side of the spectrum. Their lower IMDb scores suggest weaker audience reception, which could be attributed to shortcomings in direction, narrative strength, or viewer relatability. Analyzing both extremes allows for a balanced understanding of audience sentiment. It not only identifies the standout titles that drive engagement but also highlights areas where Netflix can refine its content strategy ‚Äî such as improving curation, promoting diverse genres, or re-evaluating underperforming productions. Ultimately, this comparison provides a meaningful glimpse into what viewers truly value and how their preferences shape the success of Netflix‚Äôs catalog.</p>


<h2>üìÖ 2. How Many Movies and Shows Fall in Each Decade in Netflix's Library?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>SQL Query:</b>
    <pre><code>
CREATE VIEW DECADE_WISE_SELECTION AS
SELECT 
  CONCAT(FLOOR(release_year/10)*10, 's') AS Decade,
  COUNT(*) AS movies_shows_count
FROM netflix_titles
GROUP BY CONCAT(FLOOR(release_year/10)*10, 's')
ORDER BY Decade;

SELECT * FROM DECADE_WISE_SELECTION;

<p>
  The decade-wise breakdown provides an overview of how Netflix‚Äôs library has evolved through time. 
  The data reveals that the majority of content comes from the 2010s and 2020s, reflecting Netflix‚Äôs 
  focus on acquiring and producing newer titles to match current audience interests. 
  Older decades, while contributing fewer titles, represent classic additions that diversify the platform‚Äôs offerings. 
  This distribution emphasizes Netflix‚Äôs strategic balance between modern content creation and maintaining a 
  nostalgic connection through select older releases.
